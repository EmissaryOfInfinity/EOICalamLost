# Calamity: The Lost Themes
Adds the five "lost" themes of the Calamity soundtrack, produced by DM Dokuro and Turquoise.

Does not actually require the Calamity mod to work, but it's a much better experience that way.

Playlist:
- Fiery Fists of Stone
- omniPOTENCE
- GARDENMETAL
- Threats of the Ocean Floor
- Blessing of the Moon
